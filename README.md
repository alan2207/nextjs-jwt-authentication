# Next.js JWT Authentication

A proof of concept app for demonstrating authentication of Next.js app with JWT. 

The app is made under the assumption that the rendering server and the API server are decoupled.

It uses [this](https://github.com/alan2207/express-server-jwt) API for authentication.

cd nextjs-jwt-authentication
npm install
